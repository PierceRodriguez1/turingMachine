## Overview ##

This project simulates a Turing Machine, where the program takes an input from a file
and simulates how the Turing Machine we develop processes the input

## Reflection
This was a challenging project but we felt like we made good progress and learned a lot throughout
this endeavor. One thing that we felt that was a big takeaway from this project, and many others that
we work on is how to work on a team. Communication is very important, there were times when one of us
both of us would work on this project at the same time, and had to figure out how to merge our commits
together. On the project side of things, we found ourselves when brainstorming to think about what 
data sturcture we want to use. We started out with hashmaps due to our familiarity with the previous 
projects. This was something that we felt comfortable using. We transitioned after thinking and beginning
to implement to linked list, because we felt that this data sturcture best suited our needs for this project,
and made the implementation smoother. 

The design process of this project seemed more challenging than others in the past. We had to think about
what classes we wanted to create and how they were going to be beneficial to this project. We gained
knowledge about using static classes in Java. This was something that was a new idea to us. In our implementation,
we later took out those static classes because as we worked on the project, we were able to refactor our
code to make it more legible and efficient. This was an important concept we learned about when developing
within a team. We ran into a bug that drove us crazy....

## Compiling and Using ##

From the terminal and the home directory of this project...

* cd tm
* javac *.java
* cd -
* java tm.TMSimulator </File/path/to/directory/filename.txt>

  There are a few options for files that you can run. There is file0.txt, file2.txt, and file5.txt as options.
